# Project 1 - Crime Watchers - Analysing Crime Data from WA

In this project the Western Australian crime data from the WA Police Force website will be analysed. Juypter Notebooks will be used to analyse the data which will be presented in class with a PowerPoint Slideshow. The following trends will be looked at:

* Does population or immigration affect the overall amount of crime in WA?
* What are the highest and lowest crimes in WA?
* What are the highest and lowest crime locations in WA?
* What was the top year for crime? Are there any yearly or monthly patterns?

Team

* Drishti Patel
* Hail Hijo
* Mel Burge
* Tyson Horsewell

*	Under or over reporting of crime in the data
*	Location data may not be accurate to the actual location on the crime

2. There are two folders with CSV files crime-data and other-data
3. Load each of the files analysis-1.ipynb and analysis-2.ipynb into Juypter in the dev environment
4. Each of the files should be able to be run to display the results
